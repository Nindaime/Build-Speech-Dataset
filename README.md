# Build-Speech-Dataset
This Solution is developed to prepreocess the tedlium speech datasets, one release at a time. The Repository converts sph to wav files, and extract the transcripts from stm files. The transcripts from Dev and Test folders are merged. The transcripts are initially stored in a dataframe with the start, end, file and transcript text. The start and end represent intervals where the transcript text is spoken. These intervals are used to segment the audio wav files. Each wav file was is broken into segments based on the intervals of the corresponding transcript. Not all speech from the audio are represented in the transcripts, therefore, this solution removes audio segments without transcriptions. Certain transcriptions contain the text "ignore_time_segment_in_scoring", whose corresponding audio contains non-speech audio. These transcripts are removed from the transcript dataframe alongside their corresponding audio segments. This dataset also removes wav audio files less than 100kB because some of these audio files introduce noise to the dataset. Some of the sub-100KB wav audio contain in-audible speech or one second speech.
