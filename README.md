# Build-Speech-Dataset
 This Solution is developed to prepreocess the tedlium datasets, one release at a time. The Repository converts sph to wav files, and extract the transcripts from stm files. The transcripts from Dev and Test folder are merged. The trainscripts are initially stored in a dataframe with the start, end, file and transcript text. The start and end represent intervals where the transcript text is spoken. These intervals are use to segment th audio wav files. Each wav file was is broken into segments based on the intervals of the corresponding transcript. Not all speech from the audio are represented in the transcripts, therefore, this solution removes audio segments without transcriptions. Certain transcriptions contain the text "ignore_time_segment_in_scoring", whose corresponding audio contain non-speech audio. These transcripts are removed from the transcript dataframe alongside their corresponding audio segments.
